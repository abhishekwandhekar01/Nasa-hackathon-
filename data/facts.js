        title: "Tides and the Moon",
        text: "The Moon's gravity exerts a tidal force on Earth that raises the oceans toward the Moon; that is why we experience high and low tides. The tidal force arises because the gravitational pull on the near side of Earth is slightly stronger than on the far side. Over long timescales, tidal interactions also slow Earth's rotation and cause the Moon to slowly recede from Earth."

        title: "Jupiter's Size and Role",
        text: "Jupiter is the largest planet in the Solar System, with a mass more than twice that of all the other planets combined. Its strong gravity has influenced the orbits of smaller bodies, and it may have played a role in shielding the inner planets from some comet impacts. Jupiter's atmosphere is mostly hydrogen and helium, featuring powerful storms like the Great Red Spot."

        title: "Saturn's Rings",
        text: "Saturn's rings are primarily composed of water ice with traces of rocky material; they range in size from tiny dust grains to chunks several meters across. The rings are divided into several main components and are shaped by gravitational interactions with Saturn's moons and shepherd moons that confine and sculpt ring edges."

        title: "Olympus Mons on Mars",
        text: "Olympus Mons is the tallest volcano in the Solar System and rises about 22 kilometers above the Martian surface. It's a shield volcano formed by successive lava flows. Because Mars lacks active plate tectonics, volcanic activity at the same hotspot over long periods allowed such a massive structure to form."

        title: "The Milky Way",
        text: "The Milky Way is a barred spiral galaxy containing between 100 and 400 billion stars; our Solar System resides roughly 27,000 light-years from the galactic center. The galaxy's structure includes a central bulge, spiral arms, and a halo populated by globular clusters."
